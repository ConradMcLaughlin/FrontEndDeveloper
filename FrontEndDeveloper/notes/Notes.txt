* Div is rectangular container, Span is inline container
* Some tags have semantic meaning - i.e. header/footer
* ol = ordered list, ul = unordered list
* You can specify the method i.e. POST, on the method
* <!--[if lt IE 9]> means if LESS THAN internet explorer 9
* form elements are used to accept input

STYLING
-------
*style changes look and feel
*A rule declared later will win


Javascript
-----------
* Prototypical inheritance instead of class-based
* Dynamic
* Script block at the bottom, so that everything on the page has been loaded.

e.g
    <script type="text/javascript">
        //Script block at the bottom, so that everything on the page has been loaded.
        
        var msg = "hello javascript"
        //alert(msg);
        console.log(msg); //Write to the console

        var resultsDiv = document.getElementById("results");
        resultsDiv.innerHTML = "<p>This is from JavaScript</p>";

    </script>

* variables do not need to be defined. Not good as you could create new variables by accident
 - therefore use the "use strict" declaration
